## üß† How It Works
1. **Backend (Express):**  
   - Starts a local server at `http://localhost:5000`.  
   - Serves a list of products from `/products`.

2. **Frontend (HTML + JS):**  
   - Uses **Axios** to send a GET request to the Express API.  
   - Displays products with their names and prices.  
   - Shows loading and error states.
